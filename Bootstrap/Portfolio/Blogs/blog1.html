                My Full Stack Web Developer Journey
            </p>
            <img src="../web-development.jpg" alt="web-development" class="wrap-Text">

            <p>
                As someone who always had an interest in technology, I found myself drawn towards web development. After completing my computer technology degree, I decided to pursue a career in web development and became a full stack web developer.
            </p>

            <p>
                My journey to becoming a full stack web developer was not easy, but it was incredibly rewarding.Here are some of the steps that I took to get where I am today:
            </p>

            <p>
                <ul>

                    <li>Learning the Basics</li>
                        <p>
                            I started by learning the basics of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript in College and in joining Kodego Bootcamp. These are the building blocks of web development, and it was important to have a solid foundation before moving on to more advanced topics.
                        </p>
                    <li>Front-end Development</li>
                        <p>
                            I focused on front-end development and learned how to create user interfaces using popular frameworks like React and Angular. I also learned how to make websites responsive and accessible across different devices and screen sizes.
                        </p>
                    <li>Back-end Development</li>
                        <p>
                            Once I felt comfortable with front-end development, I moved on to back-end development. I learned how to use Node.js and other server-side technologies to build complex web applications and APIs.
                        </p>
                    <li>Databases and Data Structures</li>
                        <p>
                            To make my web applications more robust, I learned about databases and data structures. I became proficient in SQL and NoSQL databases and learned how to use them to store and retrieve data.
                        </p>
                    <li>Full Stack Development</li>
                        <p>
                            Finally, I combined all of my knowledge and skills to become a full stack web developer. I learned how to integrate front-end and back-end technologies to create fully functional web applications.
                        </p>



                </ul>
            </p>

            <p>
                Throughout my journey, I encountered challenges and obstacles, but I was determined to overcome them. I spent countless hours reading documentation, watching tutorials, and practicing my skills. I also sought out mentorship and guidance from more experienced developers.
            </p>

            <p>
                One of the biggest challenges I faced was keeping up with the constantly evolving landscape of web development.New frameworks, libraries, and technologies emerge all the time, and it can be overwhelming to keep up. However, I found that by staying curious and dedicated to learning, I was able to adapt and stay ahead of the curve.
            </p>

            <p>
                Another challenge was dealing with imposter syndrome. As a self-taught developer, I often felt like I didn't belong in the tech industry. However, I realized that this was a common feeling among many developers, regardless of their background or experience. I learned to overcome my doubts and insecurities by focusing on my strengths and continuously improving my skills.
            </p>

            <p>
                Overall, my journey to becoming a full stack web developer was a challenging but fulfilling experience. I am grateful for the knowledge and skills that I have gained with Kodego Instructors and am excited to continue learning and growing in this dynamic field.
            </p>
