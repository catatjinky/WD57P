/* 
    Provides a symantec media query from the following: 
    Respond above XX(screen sizes)
    Respond below XX
    Respond between XX and XX

    Whereas:
    XX is the two letter  bootstrap breakpoint )i.e sm, md)

    Syntax for media query
    @media (min-width:768px) and (,ax-width:991px) 
    {
        Target devices between 768px and 991px
    }
    It's best practice to use Boostrap breakpoints in your own code but it's painful to write them all the time
